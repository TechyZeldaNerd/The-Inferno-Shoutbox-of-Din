This plugin requires the latest development version of Plugin Library (as it includes a bugfix for mybb 1.8), otherwise the CSS may not insert correctly. You can grab that at: https://github.com/frostschutz/MyBB-PluginLibrary 
The plugin is updated for 1.8, it WILL NOT work on 1.6.

If you encounter errors loading the shoutbox, make sure that all files are readable by the webserver and that /inc/plugins/inferno/anus.php is writable. Also make sure that optimizations such as Rocketloader on Cloudflare are turned off.
